# 100 Days of SwiftUI and Beyond

This blog is to hlep me learn the Swift programming language. I am scheduled to teach a course, CSC 118: Swift Programming at A-B Tech Community College in the fall of 2020. In this blog I plan to use and write about two resources I'm currently using,
1. [Apple's Intro to App Development with Swift](https://books.apple.com/us/book/intro-to-app-development-with-swift/id1118575552)
2. [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

The site created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://charliekwallin.github.io/swift-100/). I still have a lot to learn about Jekyll too! Good fun.

I'm keep the exercise files I use while learning new Swift code in the repo for this site.
