I'll add another post about Swift as soon as I actually dig into the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). In the mean time this is my first post using Jekyll and GitHub pages. So far it has been pretty fun. I'm sure I'll get distracted by Jekyll themes and whatnot so next post will be about Swift UI.
