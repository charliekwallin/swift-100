Technically all of the chapters in the book are called "lessons". I'm probably too lazy to go back and edit 20 files. From here till the end of the book, I'll refer to them as lessons.



## ColorMix project

Since the book is outdated, I'm including this image as a reference for students in CSC 118. One of the differences is that in the book you select a Device.

Ugh... maybe the constant drip of Covid-19 has scrambled my brain. Today was a mess. Even my link in markdown isn't working <sigh>. I hope that I am the only one who sees these notes.

### Many views

There are a lot of view objects to pick from, **View** no longer exists so I went with **Image View**

## To be continued

I spent too much time today figuring out the interface. I'm starting to get the hang of it but I need to review the lesson. 

Day 22 will be the same lesson except that I will have it finished. This was good for me to go through and there are some bumps that students will need to know about.

### Posting repo

Once finished, I will post the project in GitHub with this blog.
