## ColorMix project

This looks like a fun project and I'm about half way through it. One problem is the content in the Lesson. It is crap (sorry, Apple). The good news is that I found an excellent set of screencasts by [iBrent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAkGwLiEYrTGCGLVS4_wVdg) that saved me a boatload of time. 

### Screencasts for this Lesson

1. [Lesson 17 Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uHEymiXpuw&list=PLXiaMWHbNgp2oJe2WhwmWSoRYvy75Z2Da&index=27)
2. [Lesson 17 Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xceOqmx7QmE&list=PLXiaMWHbNgp2oJe2WhwmWSoRYvy75Z2Da&index=28)

### Posting repo

Once finished, I will post the project in GitHub with this blog.
