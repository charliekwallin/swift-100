Structs are simple enough at first but you can add _calculated_ variables which is really cool. I found the book's example unnecessarily convoluted. What I do like about it is that it shows the _calculated_ variable and a _method_.  Here it is.

```swift
struct Rectangle {
    let width: Int
    let height: Int
    var area: Int {
        return width * height
    }
    
    func isBiggerThan(_ rectangle: Rectangle) -> Bool {
        let areaOne = area
        let areaTwo = rectangle.width * rectangle.height
        return areaOne > areaTwo
    }
}

let rectangle = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 10)
let otherRectangle = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 20)

rectangle.isBiggerThan(otherRectangle)
otherRectangle.isBiggerThan(rectangle)

```
This example is bugs me, but it will have to do until I come up with one on my own.
