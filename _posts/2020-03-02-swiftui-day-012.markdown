## Swift Over Coffee - S2E2

### Proing the heck out of that bono

Again, the content is over my head but this does not discourage me; if anything, this encourages me to learn more. Some of the topics I found interesting is the "What's new" section. It is great to hear the level of expertise that Paul and Erica have.  

I learned a little about Radars and how the development community can help make Swift a better product.

They discussed how quickly you can create a website due to frameworks than you can with app development. SwiftUI is suppose to help reduce the development time for apps. Of course, I'm a beginner so time will tell for me.

## _Intro_ Chapter 11

Coming this afternoon but I'm posting this thing now before class.
