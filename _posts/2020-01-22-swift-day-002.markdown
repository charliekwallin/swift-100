# Complex types

Egads! This got difficult quickly. Here is a list of the complex types covered today.

* Arrays
* Sets
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Enums
  
The definitions are from 100 Days of SwiftUI

## Arrays

Arrays are collections of values that are stored as a single value.

```swift
let mandolin = "Peggy"
let whistle = "Hug"
let banjo = "Tim"
let fiddle = "Philip"
let concertina = "Charlie"

let session = [mandolin, whistle, banjo, fiddle, concertina]
```

## Sets

Sets are collections of values just like arrays, except they have two differences:

1. Items aren’t stored in any order; they are stored in what is effectively a random order.
2. No item can appear twice in a set; all items must be unique.

```swift
    let instruments = Set(['Fiddle', 'Concertina', 'Whistle])
```

## Tuples

Tuples allow you to store several values together in a single value. That might sound like arrays, but tuples are different:

1. You can’t add or remove items from a tuple; they are fixed in size.
2. You can’t change the type of items in a tuple; they always have the same types they were created with.
3. You can access items in a tuple using numerical positions or by naming them, but Swift won’t let you read numbers or names that don’t exist.

```swift
let name = (first: 'Caitlin', last: 'Nic Gabhann')
```





The quiz was much more difficult. I need to review Dictionaries as I tanked the quiz.

I am going to move on to conditionals and operators. These topics were a little advanced and  I need to spend some time working on programming with them.
