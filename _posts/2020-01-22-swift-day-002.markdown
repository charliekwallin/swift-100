Egads! This got difficult quickly. Here is a list of the complex types covered today.

# Complex types

The definitions are from 100 Days of SwiftUI

## Arrays

Arrays are collections of values that are stored as a single value.

```swift
let mandolin = "Peggy"
let whistle = "Hug"
let banjo = "Tim"
let fiddle = "Philip"
let concertina = "Charlie"

let session = [mandolin, whistle, banjo, fiddle, concertina]
```

* Sets
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Enums

The quiz was much more difficult. I need to review Dictionaries as I tanked the quiz.
