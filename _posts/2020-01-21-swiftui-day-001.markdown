# Introduction

Day 1 of SwiftUI is pretty quick since I have already learned about Swift's main data types. At this point it is all easy. It was nice to have the quizzes to check if I really was learning. Here are a few things I learned.

## Multi-line strings

These must start with three quotes `"""` and end with three quotes on a separate line. 

```swift
var text = """
    This is some text
    over multiple lines
    """
```

If you don't want the newline character inserted, then add it yourself 

```swift
var text = """
    This is some text \
    over multiple lines
    """
```

## Assigning values to variables

Unlike PHP, Swift will perform a data check. For instance you can't assign an integer to a boolean.

Here I am explicitly declaring the data type

```swift
let hungry: Bool = true
```

The following would be false because Bool does not recognize zero

```swift
let hungry: Bool = 0
```

## Enough

I'm going to call it an early day. I already spent too much time goofing around with Jekyll and GitHub pages.
