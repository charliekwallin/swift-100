This chapter was significantly easier than Complex Data Types (as it should be). Not much to write about here as the operators all made sense and the syntax was pretty straight forward. If I look at this blog as a way for me to keep notes, then this is all for today. Next up is loops then it looks like it gets more interesting with functions followed by closures.
