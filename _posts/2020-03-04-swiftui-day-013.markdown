## Quick note on comparing ints and doubles

The following confuses me. It returns **true**.

1 == 1.0 

## Using functions to returns bools

### Using a conditional in your return statement

This is right out of the chapter. Note the `return` statement.

```swift
func bandCanCarryGear(bandMemberCount: Int, gearWeight: Int) -> Bool {
    let maximumTripCount = 2
    let weightPerPerson = 50
    let carryingCapacity = bandMemberCount * weightPerPerson * maximumTripCount

    return gearWeight < carryingCapacity
}

if bandCanCarryGear(bandMemberCount: 5, gearWeight: 600) {
   "Rock on."
} else {
    "Everyone quits! Looks like you've got a solo show"
}
```

## TODO

Otherwise the chapter was pretty straight forward. There is a good exercise in the **Teacher's Ed** to validate a password. I'm going to write that one soon but first I must get the boy on the bus.
