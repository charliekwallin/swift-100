## Enumerators

>In Swift, you can use an enumeration to represent a group of related choices. Each choice is called a case.

```swift
enum tuneChoice {
    case reel
    case jig
    case hornpipe
    case polka
}
```

### Enumerator lists 

* Are exhaustive
* Naming convention is singular, `tuneChoice` not `tuneChoices`.

### Type annotation

Variables can use type annotation as follows

```swift
let firstSet: tuneChoice

firstSet = .hornpipe
```

Although he sometimes bumbles through his videos and should strongly consider some editing, I am grateful to him for picking up and finishing where Apple dropped the ball.

More to come but I'm pushing this anyway.
