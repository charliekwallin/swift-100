`Date()` is an example of an _initializer_.  Initializers are used to create an instance of a particular type.

> Functions can be defined as part of a type. These functions are called instance methods, or just methods. 

## Instance method
There was a short exercise on the instance method, `hasPrefix(_:)`. I mention this because it seemed a little weird at first but I'm starting to get the hang of it. 

This instance method returns a Boolean value indicating whether the string begins with the specified prefix.

## Instance property

You cannot pass arguments to a property.

`var isEmpty: Bool { get }`

```swift
let something = "It was the best of times"
something.isEmpty
```

## Assistant Editor

In the last assignment with the dueling boogie bots, the instructions in this chapter state that you should open the assistant editor. For me it opened automatically. 

Explanation from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56675698/show-assistant-editor-missing-in-xcode-11)

In the playground, I toggled the boogie bots with Editor -> Layout -> Assistant on Right then run Live View or I could just run Live View.
