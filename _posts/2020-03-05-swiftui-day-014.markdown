`Date()` is an example of an _initializer_.  Initializers are used to create an instance of a particular tuype.

> Functions can be defined as part of a type. These functions are called instance methods, or just methods. 

## Instance method
There was a short exercise on the instance method, `hasPrefix(_:)`. I mention this because it seemed a little weird at first but I'm starting to get the hang of it. 

This instance method returns a Boolean value indicating whether the string begins with the specified prefix.

## Instance property

You cannot pass arguments to a property.

`var isEmpty: Bool { get }`

```swift
let something = "It was the best of times"
something.isEmpty
```
