## More Functions

Chapter 10 in the _Intro_ book finally gets a little more interesting and delves deeper into functions. When putting together the class, I need to figure out how to keep the students interested during chapters 1 - 6. Chapter 7 with Boogie Bot was fun and I understand why it is there, but those chapters are pretty light. On the other hand, the chapter on functions _100 Days_ videos is too complete if you are just beginning. Here are some more notes on functions

### Returning values

```swift
func makeFavorite(categoryOfThing: String, favorite: String) -> String {
    
    return "My favorite \(categoryOfThing) is \(favorite)"
}

let sentence = makeFavorite(categoryOfThing: "food", favorite: "oats")
print(sentence)
```
More material coming after I walk the dog.
