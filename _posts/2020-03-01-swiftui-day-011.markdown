I know, I'm probably spending too much time on functions this early in my learning but I really need to understand (even at a beginning level) how they work in Swift. Even after going through chapter 10 in the _Intro_ book and the accompanying playground, I wasn't fully grasping the whole argument label thing. Here is my summary: it is a way to make your functions read more like a sentence (which is cool), but it also adds a little bit of wordiness that I found unnecessary. I guess it's not that difficult after all. I'm sure with other topics such as **tuples**, I'll eventually understand why these were designed into the language.

I reviewed the _100 Days_ function tutorial. It explained it as: the **argument label** is used in the function call, while the parameter is used in the function. Here is the code for that example

```swift
func sayHello(to name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

sayHello(to: "Rennie")
```

Here is the code from the playground exercise. I modified it slightly from the original example. Perhaps a better example would help me see the value, alas here it is

```swift
func score(withReds reds: Int, withGreens greens: Int, withGolds golds: Int) -> Int {
    let pointsPerRed = 5
    let pointsPerGreen = 10
    let pointsPerGold = 30
    
    let redScore = reds * pointsPerRed
    let greenScore = greens * pointsPerGreen
    let goldScore = golds * pointsPerGold
    
    return redScore + greenScore + goldScore
}
let finalScore = score(withReds: 5, withGreens: 3, withGolds: 3)
```

There is still a lot more for me to learn about functions such as **variadic** functions and functions that **throw** buy I think this will be enough for now. Time to move on to conditionals in chapter 11.
