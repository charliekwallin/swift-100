## Simple Center

In this app we are to learn about working with user interfaces.

### Auto Layout

Need to select Main.storyboard for the View As: button to show. It's at the bottom. This allows you to pick the 4s.

Without Auto Layout, the Label I added always stays at the same coordinates whenever I change devices. Auto Layout to the rescue.

This is pretty nice.
