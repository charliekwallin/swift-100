## More Functions

Perhaps I'm spending too much time in this chapter but it offers a lot. I wrote out a function for students to use as a stepping stone to better code. As I learn more about arrays and loops, I will add those for practice. Here is my first, and somewhat embarrassing attempt to use a function to guide me through the repetition of a song.

### Bob and Doug's 12 Days of Christmas - Take One

```swift
func bobAndDoug(intro: String, day: String, trueLove: String, gift: String) -> String {
    return "\(intro)\(day)day of Christmas, \(trueLove)\(gift)"
}

let intro = "On the "
let trueLove = "my true love gave to me, "

let one = "first "
let two = "second "
let three = "third"

let firstDayGift = "a beer."
let secondDayGift = "two turtlenecks."
let thirdDayGift = "three french toast."

let firstVerse = bobAndDoug(intro: intro, day: one, trueLove: trueLove, gift: firstDayGift)
let secondVerse = bobAndDoug(intro: intro, day: two, trueLove: trueLove, gift: secondDayGift)
let thirdVerse = bobAndDoug(intro: intro, day: three, trueLove: trueLove, gift: thirdDayGift)

print (firstVerse)
print (secondVerse)
print (thirdVerse)
```
