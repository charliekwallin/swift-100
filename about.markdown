I am an instructor in the Software and Web Program at [A-B Tech CC](https://www.abtech.edu/). I am scheduled to teach CSC 118: Introduction to Swift Programming in the fall of 2020. As part of my preparation I'm taking on the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). In addition I will be completing Apple's _Intro to App Development_.
